# Contest 1: Simple Algorithms

This folder contains my solutions for the first contest. The main topics are basic sorting algorithms, binary search, and two pointers.

## Tasks:
* **A.cpp** - Finding the minimum in an array excluding a specific segment (using prefix and suffix minimums).
* **B.cpp** - Finding a contiguous subarray with the maximum geometric mean.
* **C.cpp** - Finding an index to minimize the maximum of two sorted arrays (one ascending, one descending) using binary/ternary search.
* **D.cpp** - Binary search on the answer. Finding the minimum length of `k` segments to cover all given points.
* **E.cpp** - Merging overlapping intervals on a coordinate line.
* **F.cpp** - Finding the k-th order statistic (QuickSelect algorithm) in a generated array.
* **G.cpp** - Implementing LSD Radix Sort byte by byte for 64-bit integers.
* **H.cpp** - Implementing standard Quick Sort.
* **I.cpp** - Counting the number of inversions in an array (implemented using Merge Sort).
