# MIPT Algorithms Course (3 Semesters)

This repository contains my solutions for the Algorithms and Data Structures course at MIPT (FPMI). 

During the 3 semesters, we solved contests on different topics. You can find the code in the folders below. Inside each folder, there is a small `README.md` with a short description of the tasks.

## Contests:
* **Contest 01:** Asymptotics and Simple Algorithms
* **Contest 02:** Sortings, Lists, and Heaps
* **Contest 03:** Sparse Tables and Segment Trees
* **Contest 04:** Search Trees (BST)
* **Contest 05:** Hash Tables
* **Contest 06:** Dynamic Programming
* **Contest 07:** Basic Graph Algorithms
* **Contest 08:** Shortest Paths and Spanning Trees
* **Contest 09:** Matchings and Network Flows
