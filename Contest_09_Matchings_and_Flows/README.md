# Contest 9: Matchings and Flows

This folder contains my solutions for bipartite graphs, specifically finding matchings and vertex covers.

## Tasks:
* **A.cpp** - Finding the maximum matching in a bipartite graph (using Kuhn's algorithm).
* **B.cpp** - Finding the minimum cost to cover empty grid cells with 1x2 dominoes and 1x1 squares. Solved by converting the grid into a bipartite graph and finding the maximum matching.
* **C.cpp** - Finding the Minimum Vertex Cover in a bipartite graph based on its maximum matching (using Kőnig's theorem).
