# Contest 3: Segment Trees and Fenwick Trees

This folder contains my solutions for the third contest. The main topics are Segment Trees and Fenwick Trees (Binary Indexed Trees).

## Tasks:
* **A.cpp** - Keeping track of user scores and calculating the fraction of users with a strictly lower score.
* **B.cpp** - A Segment Tree to calculate the alternating sum on a given segment with point updates.
* **E.cpp** - Adding numbers to a multiset and finding the sum of all numbers less than or equal to X.
* **G.cpp** - A 2D Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree) for 2D point updates (+1) and calculating the sum in a rectangle.
