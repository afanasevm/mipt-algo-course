# Contest 5: Hash Tables

This folder contains my solutions for the fifth contest. The main rule here was to write Hash Tables from scratch without using standard libraries like `std::unordered_set` or `std::unordered_map`.

## Tasks:
* **A.cpp** - My own implementation of a Hash Set. It supports fast adding, removing, and checking if a number exists.
* **B.cpp** - Finding common elements (intersection) between two collections, including their counts. Solved using my custom Hash Table.
