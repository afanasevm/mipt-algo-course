# Contest 7: Basic Graph Algorithms

This folder contains my solutions for basic graph algorithms. We used DFS (Depth-First Search) and BFS (Breadth-First Search) to explore graphs and find their properties.

## Tasks:
* **A.cpp** - Finding a cycle in a directed graph.
* **B.cpp** - Finding connected components in an undirected graph.
* **C.cpp** - Topological sorting of a directed graph.
* **D.cpp** - Finding Strongly Connected Components (SCC) and building a condensation graph.
* **E.cpp** - Finding all bridges in an undirected graph.
* **F.cpp** - Finding all articulation points (cut vertices) in an undirected graph.
* **G.cpp** - Finding the minimum number of edges to add so the graph has no bridges.
* **H.cpp** - Solving a system of equations on a graph (restoring vertex values from edge sums).
* **I.cpp** - Restoring edge weights (0 or 1) based on the odd/even parity of the vertices.
