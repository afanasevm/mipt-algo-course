# Contest 2: Sortings, Lists, and Heaps

This folder contains my solutions for the second contest. The main topics are stacks, queues, monotonic queues, and heaps (priority queues).

## Tasks:
* **A.cpp** - Checking if a bracket sequence is correct using a Stack.
* **B.cpp** - Finding the largest rectangle of 1s in a matrix using a Monotonic Stack.
* **C.cpp** - Implementing a special Queue that can push elements to the middle.
* **D.cpp** - Implementing a Queue that can find the minimum element in O(1) time (using two stacks).
* **E.cpp** - Finding the number of smaller elements to the right for each array element.
* **F.cpp** - Writing a Binary Min-Heap from scratch with a `decreaseKey` operation.
* **G.cpp** - Finding the `k` smallest elements in a huge array using a Max-Heap (with strict memory limits).
* **H.cpp** - Min-Max Heap: a custom data structure that can extract both the minimum and maximum elements.
* **K.cpp** - Finding minimums in all sliding submatrices using a 2D Monotonic Queue.
* **L.cpp** - 3D sliding window maximum to simulate a spaceship's path.
* **M.cpp** - Solving a game theory problem on a circular array.
